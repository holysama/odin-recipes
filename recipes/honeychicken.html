        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These harissa honey chicken thighs are a spicy-sweet delight, rubbed in harissa paste
             and honey, then baked to perfection. Adjust the amount of harissa paste to suit your spice preference.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons harissa paste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 green onion, thinly sliced</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
            <li>Stir harissa paste, honey, olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, coriander, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Rub the mixture over each chicken thigh and under the skin, ensuring each thigh is coated evenly. Place chicken thighs skin-side up in a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is cooked through and the skin is browned and caramelized, 35 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish with green onions.</li>
